## Data Preparation

In this exercise, you will perform an **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA)

### Data Schema

✏️ Your first challenge is to build the data schema of `olist` using [kitt.lewagon.com/db](https://kitt.lewagon.com/db). Don't forget to quick-save it regularly ("F2") to your Kitt profile.

We have written for you a detailed description of the data schema in `csv/README.md`. The `.md` format (called "Markdown") is better rendered visually using github, [here](https://github.com/lewagon/data-challenges/tree/master/04-Decision-Science/data) for instance


### Data Loader

We'll load csv data in a Python class and pandas DataFrame, which will come in handy throughout the week.

✏️ Open `data_preparation.ipynb` and follow instructions
