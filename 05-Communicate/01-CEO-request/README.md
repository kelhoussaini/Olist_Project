### Finalize your analysis

Continue working on yesterday's `ceo-request.ipynb` notebook as needed to answer the question:

> _Should Olist remove underperforming sellers from its marketplace?_

🚀 Feel free to start from the solutions `seller_updated_solution.py` and `product_updated_solution.py` available to download from yesterday's recap challenge. They contain `profits_per_seller` and `profits_per_product`.

### Present your analysis at 5pm

You have 5 minutes per person (Q&A included) to convince the Olist CEO of your recommendations.

- We will create one group of students per Teacher/TA
- Each one of you will present your analysis in front of your group
- The TA will play the role of the CEO.

### Create jupyter notebook slides !

You will have to make a slide-based presentation using Jupyter Notebook **nbconvert**

👉 Follow the `slide_like_a_pro.ipynb` guide to learn how to make them

🏁 Stop your analyses by 2pm to have time to polish your presentation and speech


### (Optional)

Feel free to extend your analysis to help improve Olist's profit margin:

- Should Olist remove only repeatedly underperforming sellers, after it has a honeymoon period of a few months
- Should Olist remove the worst performing products / categories from its marketplace entirely?
- Should Olist restrict  pairs (seller, customer) between certain states to avoid delays?
- Should Olist acquire new sellers, with some cost assumptions to be suggested?
- ...
