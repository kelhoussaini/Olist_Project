## Orders: Create a training Set 🏋️‍

Today, we will investigate the **orders**, and their associated `review_score`.

For that purpose, we will create one single data table containing all unique orders as index and all possible properties of these orders as columns.

As you may have noticed, information is scattered between the various olist data tables. Therefore, we will save in `olist/order.py` all logic needed to return a training set at the order level. This will come in handy for our next modeling phase.

👉 Open `orders.ipynb` and follow the instructions
